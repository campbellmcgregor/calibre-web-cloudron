LDAP and mail is supported but the interface uses a database to store settings, due to the process the app uses
it is not possible to inject the correct settings for your Cloudron.

If you wish to setup the LDAP and Mail integrations, the text file in the /app/data folder will provide the required
credentials to setup the features in the admin interface.

Username: admin
Password: admin123

Ensure you change the password on first login
